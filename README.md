# Movie-Rental-Dataset-Analysis
This is a project that analyzes a DVD rental store dataset with Postgres SQL. With the use various concepts / functions  (aggregate functions, CTEs etc) in Postgres SQL, some prompted questions were answered. An ER Diagram will be provided for better understanding of the dataset.

Finally, a short visualization report was created using Powerpoint to communicate the results of these questions to both technical and non technical audience.
